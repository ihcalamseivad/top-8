        <h4>Babe Ruth  (click image for wiki page)</h4>

<p>Baseball, often referred to as America's pastime, is a sport steeped in tradition and history. Originating in the 18th century and evolving into its modern form by the late 19th century, baseball is played between two teams of nine
    
    players each. The game unfolds on a diamond-shaped field with four bases arranged in a square, where one team bats while the other fields. The objective is to score runs by hitting a ball thrown by the pitcher and successfully making
    
    it around all four bases before the opposing team can retrieve the ball and tag the runner out.</p>
    <p>What makes baseball captivating is its blend of strategy, skill, and anticipation. From the tension-filled moments of a pitcher's duel to the explosive excitement of a home run, every play holds the potential for drama and excitement.
        
        Beyond its action on the field, baseball holds a cherished place in American culture, with its traditions, icons, and folklore woven into the fabric of society. Whether played professionally in stadiums packed with fans or casually in local
        
        parks and sandlots, baseball continues to capture the hearts and imaginations of millions, serving as a timeless symbol of community, competition, and the enduring spirit of the game.</p>
